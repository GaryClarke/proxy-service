<h1>Branch Summary: Constructing Apple Handlers with Forwarders</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    In this branch, we update the construction of the AppleHandler so that it is instantiated with a slice of EventForwarders.
    Previously, we relied on a default constructor call (with no arguments), and this led to build failures in the main package.
    To address this, we now inject at least one forwarder into the AppleHandler via its constructor.
</p>

<h2>Key Changes</h2>
<h3>1. Constructor Update</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        The AppleHandler constructor (<code>NewAppleHandler</code>) now requires a slice of forwarders.
        For example:
        <pre><code>func NewAppleHandler(forwarders []forwarder.EventForwarder) *AppleHandler {
    return &AppleHandler{forwarders: forwarders}
}</code></pre>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Updating Main and Tests</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        In <code>cmd/api/main.go</code> and <code>cmd/api/testutils_test.go</code>, the call to <code>NewAppleHandler()</code>
        now fails because no forwarders are provided. This branch addresses the issue by injecting a forwarder instance.
    </li>
    <li>
        For testing and development purposes, a stub forwarder can be used. However, in main, we plan to eventually substitute this with a fully implemented forwarder.
    </li>
    <li>
        For example, the main file might now contain:
        <pre><code>// Construct forwarders slice (for now, using a stub).
forwarders := []forwarder.EventForwarder{
    &forwarder.StubForwarder{},
}
appleHandler := handler.NewAppleHandler(forwarders)
</code></pre>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Future Directions</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Although the current solution uses a stub forwarder (for both testing and main), the goal is to implement a real forwarder
        that properly forwards events to an external service (such as Segment, or another system).
    </li>
    <li>
        In subsequent branches, we will focus on replacing the stub with full forwarder logic and update the corresponding test cases accordingly.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Considerations</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Explicit Dependency Injection:</strong>
        Our approach of passing a slice of forwarders to the constructor makes dependencies explicit,
        enhancing clarity and testability.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Gradual Enhancement:</strong>
        Using a stub forwarder initially allows us to integrate and test the new AppleHandler construction without introducing “magic”
        from a dependency container, and it sets the stage for implementing a full forwarder later.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Consistency and Clarity:</strong>
        Updating the main package and tests to pass the correct parameters eliminates build failures and ensures that
        the runtime configuration mirrors the intended production setup.
    </li>
</ul>
