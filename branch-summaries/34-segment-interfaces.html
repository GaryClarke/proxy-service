<h1>Branch Summary: Segment Interfaces</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    In this branch, we introduced two new interfaces—<code>IdentifyConverter</code> and <code>TrackConverter</code>—designed to abstract
    the conversion of our internal payload structures into Segment events. These interfaces provide a flexible and testable way to build
    Segment messages (identify and track) using the <code>github.com/segmentio/analytics-go</code> library.
</p>

<h2>Key Changes</h2>
<h3>1. IdentifyConverter Interface</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Defined in <code>internal/segment/identify/identify.go</code> (or a similar location), the <code>IdentifyConverter</code> interface
        specifies a single method:
        <pre><code>type IdentifyConverter interface {
    // ToIdentify converts the implementation to an analytics.Identify message,
    // which can then be enqueued for sending to Segment.
    ToIdentify() analytics.Identify
}
      </code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        This interface is intended to be implemented by any type (typically a payload struct) that encapsulates the data for an
        identify event. By using this interface, our code remains decoupled from the specific data structures, and we gain flexibility to swap implementations,
        especially during testing.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>2. TrackConverter Interface</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Similarly, in <code>internal/segment/track/track.go</code>, the <code>TrackConverter</code> interface is defined as:
        <pre><code>type TrackConverter interface {
    // ToTrack converts the implementation into an analytics.Track message,
    // which can then be enqueued for sending to Segment.
    ToTrack() analytics.Track
}
      </code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        This interface allows for the conversion of various payloads into Track messages. It is especially useful because different parts of
        our application might produce track events with varying data, and using an interface standardizes the conversion process.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Naming Considerations</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        We intentionally chose the names <code>IdentifyConverter</code> and <code>TrackConverter</code> to emphasize that these interfaces
        focus on converting internal payloads to the corresponding Segment message structures (identify and track, respectively).
    </li>
    <li>
        Using the term "Converter" avoids confusion with a payload that is simply a data container. It clarifies that the main responsibility of
        any implementation is to perform the conversion.
    </li>
    <li>
        This naming also helps differentiate these interfaces from other kinds of "models" or "payloads" in the application, making their purpose explicit,
        and it fits well with Go’s preference for clear, descriptive names.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Considerations & Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        These interfaces enable a decoupled design that enhances testability. During unit tests, you can provide fake implementations of these converters
        to verify that the rest of your event-forwarding pipeline behaves as expected.
    </li>
    <li>
        In future branches, we will implement concrete types that satisfy these interfaces. These types will map our internal data to the specific attributes
        required by Segment’s Identify and Track methods.
    </li>
    <li>
        This design keeps the code modular and opens the possibility for further enhancements, such as validation or additional transformation logic,
        without impacting the rest of the system.
    </li>
</ul>
