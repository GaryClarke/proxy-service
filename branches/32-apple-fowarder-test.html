<h1>Branch Summary: Apple Forwarder Test</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    In this branch, we introduced a table-driven test for the Apple forwarder to ensure that its behavior is correct.
    Specifically, we test the <code>Supports</code> method of the <code>AppleSubscriptionStartForwarder</code> for both the
    happy path (when the event category matches <code>CATEGORY_START</code>) and the failure scenario (when it does not).
</p>

<h2>Key Changes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Created <code>apple_test.go</code> in the forwarder package to isolate and test the Apple forwarder's functionality.
    </li>
    <li>
        Implemented a table-driven test that iterates over test cases with different event categories.
        The tests validate that the <code>Supports</code> method returns <code>true</code> when the event category matches
        <code>CATEGORY_START</code> and <code>false</code> otherwise.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Testing Strategy</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Table-Driven Testing:</strong>
        By using a table-driven approach, multiple scenarios are defined in a single test function, similar to data providers in other frameworks.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Scenario Coverage:</strong>
        The test covers both the happy path and an error scenario, ensuring that the forwarder behaves as expected across different inputs.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        With the basic behavior of the forwarder verified, the next steps will involve implementing and testing the full forwarding logic.
    </li>
    <li>
        Additional tests for other forwarders (such as those for Google events) can be added to ensure consistent behavior across platforms.
    </li>
</ul>
